See the [Cleodora Demo](https://demo.cleodora.org/).

Software to track personal forecasts/predictions and systematically improve at
making them.

Examples of such forecasts:

* Will "The Fabelmans" win "Best Picture" at the Oscars 2023?
* Will I get an A in my upcoming exam?
* Will there be nice weather on my birthday?
* Will the number of contributors for "Cleodora" be more than 5 at the end of
  2023?

Below an example mockup for how a user kept updating their "Will aliens be
found on the moon in 2022?" forecast due to new information. Analyzing such a
forecasting history is what will help them improve. You can find more such
mockups on the website https://cleodora.org/docs/development/roadmap/mockups/ .
