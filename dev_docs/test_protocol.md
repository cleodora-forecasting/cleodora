# E2E Test Protocol

Since I currently run the end to end tests locally and I don't run them for every commit
sometimes for debugging purposes it might be useful to determine when they were last successful.

| Commit  | Date       | Successful |
| ------- | ---------- | :--------: |
| 97365c3 | 2023-11-14 | ✔️         |
