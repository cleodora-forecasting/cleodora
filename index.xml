Mindy the engineer # Mindy is an engineer who works at a company that just hired a new CEO on January 1st 2022. She predicts he will leave the company by the end of the year.
Mindy makes the following forecast on January 2nd 2022:
Will Tom, our new CEO, leave the company by December 31st 2022? Prediction: Yes Confidence: 60% Reasoning: His track record shows that he switched companies 8 times in the last 10 years and I have a bad gut feeling about him.</description></item><item><title>Comparison with other tools</title><link>https://cleodora.org/docs/comparison/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cleodora.org/docs/comparison/</guid><description>Comparison with other tools # Manifold Markets # Cleodora is different from Manifold Markets because:
Running it locally on your computer will be the default and all forecasts are private whereas, on Manifold everything is public. Cleodora is about your own forecasts, not other people&amp;rsquo;s. You can directly measure the quality of your forecasts instead of only indirectly via the amount of M$ (mana) you earn over time, meaning you can better drill down where exactly you failed in specific instances.</description></item><item><title>Dev Guidelines</title><link>https://cleodora.org/docs/development/dev-guidelines/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cleodora.org/docs/development/dev-guidelines/</guid><description>Dev Guidelines # The following should be prioritized, in particular over feature completeness:
Long-term maintainability, including a high degree of automation and tests Easy setup and excellent &amp;lsquo;Getting Started&amp;rsquo; documentation for new contributors Simplicity of use Personal use and privacy When in doubt, new features will not be added. It&amp;rsquo;s better to do a few things, but do them very well.</description></item><item><title>Technology</title><link>https://cleodora.org/docs/development/technology/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cleodora.org/docs/development/technology/</guid><description>Technology # I have a vague idea that the combination of a Go backend with a ReactJS frontend could work well.
Go makes it easy to create a single binary for different platforms I personally like Go React seems to be very popular and battle-tested If using Go, then Gin could be a good choice as a framework.
GraphQL instead of REST could be a design paradigm for the API consumed by the frontend.</description></item><item><title>Contact &amp; Feedback</title><link>https://cleodora.org/docs/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cleodora.org/docs/contact/</guid><description>Contact &amp;amp; Feedback # Feedback and suggestions are very welcome!

Essentially all decisions we take are based on vague gut-level predictions. For example before leaving for the airport you predict how much the traffic will delay you on your way, timing your departure appropriately. You also make a prediction about how likely you think it is your car will suffer a catastrophic engine failure on the road.</description></item><item><title>Credits</title><link>https://cleodora.org/docs/credits/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cleodora.org/docs/credits/</guid><description> Credits # &amp;lsquo;External link&amp;rsquo; icon, used in the menu, free with attribution from flaticon.com</description></item></channel></rss>
