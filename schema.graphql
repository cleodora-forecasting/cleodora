  The point in time at which you no longer want to update your probability
  estimates for the forecast. In most cases you won't need this. One example
  where you might is when you want to predict the outcome of an exam. You may
  want to set 'closes' to the time right before the exam starts, even though
  'resolves' is several weeks later (when the exam results are published). This
  way your prediction history will only reflect your estimations before you
  took the exam, which is something you may want (or not, in which case you
  could simply not set 'closes').
