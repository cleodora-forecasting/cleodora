# About

## Elevator pitch

Cleodora is an open source piece of software that does not exist yet. I am
looking for people to collaborate in creating it.

It's a web application that you can download to your computer and then access
via your web browser

The goal is to track personal forecasts and, by getting feedback on your
performance, systematically improve at making such forecasts.

For example you can forecast "Will I increase my salary by 20% within the next
24 months?". You predict "Yes" with a confidence of 60%. As the months pass you
keep adjusting your confidence up and down depending on new information you get
(quarterly sales figures, feedback from the boss, inflation). Every time you
adjust your prediction, Cleodora will ask you to justify why you are doing it.

After 24 months have passed you realize your salary only increased by 12%, so
you resolve your forecast as "No". Cleodora will then tell how how accurate
your forecasts were over time and you can analyze your reasoning for adjusting
up or down. In the future you will then avoid some of the pitfalls that made
you inaccurate in your predictions.

Cleodora is not a prediction market. A prediction market tries to maximize
profits for individual forecasters. At the same time the aggregated knowledge
of all the traders is reflected in the market and make this market a very
accurate forecast in itself.

Cleodora is specifically for improving your own forecasts. Training this
ability is something you could then use to make profits in a prediction market.

Later versions of Cleodora will support making forecasts publicly or within a
group to hold forecasting competitions where everyone is competing to make the
most accurate forecasts on the same issues. The main use case will always be
making personal, private forecasts and systematically improving at making them.

## Why care about forecasting?

Forecasting is an important skill. Essentially all decisions we take are based
on vague gut-level predictions. For example before leaving for the airport you
predict how much the traffic will delay you on your way, timing your departure
appropriately. You also make a prediction about how likely you think it is your
car will suffer a catastrophic engine failure on the road. If you thought this
was very likely to happen, you would take a cab instead. Making such forecasts
explicit and tracking your accuracy can be incredibly valuable.

## Why the focus on running Cleodora on your own computer?

To enable you to make deeply personal predictions (e.g. will my uncle find a
new partner within the next 6 months?) without worrying about who gets to
(accidentally) read your thoughts. Also it emphasizes the fact that the tool is
about YOUR forecasts, not other people's.

Given that it's a web application you will be able to host it yourself e.g. on
small home server and access it from any device within that network.

Later versions of Cleodora will also have a public instance with multiple
users, but the focus will always be on personal forecasts.

## Why the name Cleodora?

Cleodora (/kliːəˈdɔːrə/) is a nymph from Greek mythology who was able to
predict the future by casting stones. She and her sisters Melaina and Daphnis
are known as the Thriae.
