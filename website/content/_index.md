## Goals

This is an open-source project for making, tracking and improving personal
forecasts such as:

* Tomorrow it will rain in my home town
* The war in Ukraine will stop before March 31st 2023
* My salary will increase by 10% within the next 12 months

Forecasting is an important skill. Essentially all decisions we take are based
on vague gut-level predictions. For example before leaving for the airport you
predict how much the traffic will delay you on your way, timing your departure
appropriately. You also make a prediction about how likely you think it is your
car will suffer a catastrophic engine failure on the road. If you thought this
was very likely to happen, you would take a cab instead. Making such forecasts
explicit and tracking your accuracy can be incredibly valuable.

The initial focus of Cleodora will be tracking these predictions individually
on your own computer. This is to enable you to even make deeply personal
forecasts (e.g. my uncle will find a new partner within the next 6 months)
without worrying about leaks to the Internet. Therefore simple installation and
usage as well as cross-platform support are a key feature.

After making your initial forecast you can keep refining your predictions and
once a question resolves (e.g. 12 months have passed and you know by how much
your salary increased) Cleodora will give you data to determine how good a
forecaster you really are. This feedback loop will help you improve over time.

## Why the name Cleodora?

Cleodora (/kliːəˈdɔːrə/) is a nymph from Greek mythology who was able to
predict the future by casting stones. She and her sisters Melaina and Daphnis
are known as the Thriae. Given that predicting the future is the skill this
project will help you improve at, the name seemed fitting.
