**Get started: [Live Demo](https://demo.cleodora.org) | [User Documentation]({{< ref "user" >}})**

Cleodora is free and **open source** software. You can use it to track
**personal forecasts** and, by getting feedback on your performance,
**systematically improve** at making such predictions/forecasts.

Cleodora is a **web application** that you can download to your computer and
then access via your web browser. It requires no setup (single binary) and
runs on Microsoft Windows, macOS and Linux.

For **example** you can forecast _"Will I increase my salary by 20% within the
next 24 months?"_. You predict "Yes" with a confidence of 60%. As the months
pass you keep adjusting your confidence up and down depending on new
information you get (quarterly sales figures, feedback from the boss,
inflation). Every time you adjust your prediction, Cleodora will ask you to
justify why you are doing it.

After 24 months have passed you realize your salary only increased by 12%, so
you resolve your forecast as "No". Cleodora will then tell how **how accurate**
your forecasts were over time and you can analyze your reasoning for adjusting
up or down. In the future you will then avoid some of the pitfalls that made
you inaccurate in your predictions.

Cleodora is **not a prediction market**. A prediction market tries to maximize
profits for individual forecasters. At the same time the aggregated knowledge
of all the traders is reflected in the market and make this market a very
accurate forecast in itself.

Cleodora is specifically for **improving your own forecasts**. Training this
ability is something you could then use to make profits in a prediction market.

**Later versions** of Cleodora will support making forecasts publicly or within
a group to hold forecasting competitions where everyone is competing to make
the most accurate forecasts on the same issues. The main use case will always
be making personal, private forecasts and systematically improving at making
them.

To install and run Cleodora have a look at the
[user documentation]({{< ref "user" >}}).
