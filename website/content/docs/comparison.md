# Comparison with other tools

## Manifold Markets

Cleodora is different from [Manifold Markets](https://manifold.markets)
because:

* Running it locally on your computer will be the default and all forecasts are
  private whereas, on Manifold everything is public.
* Cleodora is about your own forecasts, not other people's.
* You can directly measure the quality of your forecasts instead of only
  indirectly via the amount of M$ (mana) you earn over time, meaning you can
  better drill down where exactly you failed in specific instances.
* If the probability you currently predict is the same as the market, then in
  Manifold there is nothing you can do. Your ability to make a forecast depends
  on other people, whereas in Cleodora it's only about you.


## Metaculus

Cleodora is different from [Metaculus](https://metaculus.com) because:

* Running it locally on your computer will be the default and all forecasts are
  private, whereas on Metaculus everything is public.
* Cleodora is about your own forecasts, not other people's.
* You are able to make forecasts that are not of public interest, whereas on
  Metaculus all forecasts are carefully curated.


## PredictionBook

Cleodora is different from [PredictionBook](https://predictionbook.com) because:

* Running it locally on your computer will be the default, and will be easier
  than with PredictionBook because Cleodora is single binary, no dependencies
  and Linux/OSX/Windows cross platform. To run PredictionBook locally you need
  Ruby on Rails.
* The Cleodora UI aims to look more modern and be mobile friendly.
* In PredictionBook it's only possible to make binary (yes/no) forecasts
  whereas making ones with several possible answers is on the roadmap for
  Cleodora.
* Development of PredictionBook seems to have stopped, except for dependency
  updates and bug fixes. Note that this is not necessarily bad. If a tool does
  what it's supposed to do, why continue tinkering with it?

That being said, if you want a great and working tool **right now**,
PredictionBook should be your choice. It essentially does everything Cleodora
aims to do in the future. The Credence game is also really cool and fun, albeit
a little US-centric.

The roadmap of Cleodora is filled with great features! But like any roadmap, it
might not survive contact with reality.
