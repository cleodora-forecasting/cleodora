Everything is a work in progress. Feedback and suggestions are very welcome!
Open a [ticket on
GitHub](https://github.com/cleodora-forecasting/cleodora/issues) or [send an

Cleodora is different from Manifold Markets because:

* Running it locally on your computer will be the default and all forecasts are
  private whereas, on Manifold everything is public
* Cleodora is about your own forecasts, not other people's
* You can directly measure the quality of your forecasts instead of only
  indirectly via the amount of M$ (mana) you earn over time, meaning you can
  better drill down where exactly you failed in specific instances

Cleodora is different from Metaculus because:

* Running it locally on your computer will be the default and all forecasts are
  private, whereas on Metaculus everything is public
* Cleodora is about your own forecasts, not other people's
* You are able to make forecasts that are not of public interest, whereas on
  Metaculus all forecasts are carefully curated
