# Comparison with other tools

Everything is a work in progress. Feedback and suggestions are very welcome!
Open a [ticket on
GitHub](https://github.com/cleodora-forecasting/cleodora/issues) or [send an
e-mail (info@cleodora.org)](mailto:info@cleodora.org).

* Cleodora is for personal predictions, not for aggregating data of multiple people
* Cleodora is for tracking your own performance and systematically improving it
* With Manifold Markets your performance is hidden with all the other ways of
  getting mana plus there is no easy way to measure whether you are improving
  or which areas you need to work on
* With Metaculus only certain kinds of general interest predictions are
  allowed, not personal ones
* Privacy is important so self-deployment is the default
