# User Documentation

Cleodora is composed of two applications that you can use: `cleosrv` and
`cleoc`. If you are unsure, use only `cleosrv`.


## cleosrv (Cleodora server)

`cleosrv` is the main application that stores the data and allows you to view
and modify it via a web browser.

Read how to install and use `cleosrv` [here]({{< ref "cleosrv" >}}).

## cleoc (Cleodora client)

`cleoc` is a CLI (command-line interface) tool that can be used to create and
modify data in `cleosrv`. You do not need to install or use it. In particular,
if you have never used a _command-line interface_ (also known as a _terminal_
or _console_) before, you should probably ignore it.
