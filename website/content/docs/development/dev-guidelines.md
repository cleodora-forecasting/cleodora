# Dev Guidelines

The following should be prioritized, in particular over feature completeness:

* Long-term maintainability, including a high degree of automation and tests
* Easy setup and excellent 'Getting Started' documentation for new contributors
* Simplicity of use
* Personal use and privacy

When in doubt, new features will not be added. It's better to do a few things,
but do them very well.
