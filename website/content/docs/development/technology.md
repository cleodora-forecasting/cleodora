# Technology

I have a vague idea that the combination of a Go backend with a ReactJS
frontend could work well.

* Go makes it easy to create a single binary for different platforms
* I personally like Go
* React seems to be very popular and battle-tested

If using Go, then Gin could be a good choice as a framework.

GraphQL instead of REST could be a design paradigm for the API consumed by the
frontend.
