# Development

Any contributions to Cleodora are more than welcome. This includes software
development, writing documentation, commenting on issues or discussions, making
proposals for new features, reporting problems, improving the UI layout,
helping users or developers and much more.

Anyone who makes any such contribution, however small, will be listed as a
contributor.

Contributing to Cleodora can also be a good chance to learn good software
development practices to advance in your career. For example extensive testing,
writing documentation, code architecture, rigorous (but kind) code reviews and
in general a high emphasis on simplicity and quality at the expense of more
features.
