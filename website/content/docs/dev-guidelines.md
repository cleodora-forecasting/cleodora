# Dev Guidelines

Everything is a work in progress. Feedback and suggestions are very welcome!
Open a [ticket on
GitHub](https://github.com/cleodora-forecasting/cleodora/issues) or [send an
e-mail (info@cleodora.org)](mailto:info@cleodora.org).

The following should be prioritized, in particular over feature completeness:

* Long-term maintainability, including a high degree of automation and tests
* Easy setup and excellent 'Getting Started' documentation for new contributors
* Simplicity of use
* Personal use and privacy

When in doubt, new features will not be added. It's better to do a few things,
but do them very well.
