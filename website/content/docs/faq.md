# FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions

## Why care about forecasting?

Forecasting is an important skill. Essentially all decisions we take are based
on vague gut-level predictions. For example before leaving for the airport you
predict how much the traffic will delay you on your way, timing your departure
appropriately. You also make a prediction about how likely you think it is your
car will suffer a catastrophic engine failure on the road. If you thought this
was very likely to happen, you would take a cab instead. Making such forecasts
explicit and tracking your accuracy can be incredibly valuable.

## Why the focus on running Cleodora on your own computer?

To enable you to make deeply personal predictions (e.g. will my uncle find a
new partner within the next 6 months?) without worrying about who gets to
(accidentally) read your thoughts. Also it emphasizes the fact that the tool is
about YOUR forecasts, not other people's.

Given that it's a web application you will be able to host it yourself e.g. on
small home server and access it from any device within that network.

Later versions of Cleodora will also have a public instance with multiple
users, but the focus will always be on personal forecasts.

## Why the name Cleodora?

Cleodora (/kliːəˈdɔːrə/) is a nymph from Greek mythology who was able to
predict the future by casting stones. She and her sisters Melaina and Daphnis
are known as the Thriae.
