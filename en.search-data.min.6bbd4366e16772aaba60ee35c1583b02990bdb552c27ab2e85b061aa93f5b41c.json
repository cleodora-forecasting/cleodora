She predicts he will leave the company by the end of the year.\nMindy makes the following forecast on January 2nd 2022:\nWill Tom, our new CEO, leave the company by December 31st 2022? Prediction: Yes Confidence: 60% Reasoning: His track record shows that he switched companies 8 times in the last 10 years and I have a bad gut feeling about him. On March 12th 2022 Mindy updates her forecast:\nConfidence: 60% → 70% Reasoning: In yesterday\u0026rsquo;s meeting Tom was unable to name our three top customers. This shows he doesn\u0026rsquo;t care about the company. On June 30th 2022 Mindy updates her forecast again:\nConfidence: 70% → 30% Reasoning: He has been showing much more interest in ongoing projects and started engaging with team leads in strategic decision making. On August 1st 2022 Mindy updates her forecast again:\nConfidence: 30% → 85% Reasoning: I am sure he will leave, just not completely sure whether it will be before the end of the year. The door to this office was not closed and I overheard him talking to a competitor. On November 4th 2022 Mindy resolves the forecast to \u0026ldquo;Yes\u0026rdquo;:\nReasoning: Tom just announced that he will leave by November 30th. Cleodora now calculates Mindy\u0026rsquo;s Brier score for her forecast. The Brier score is a common measure for forecast accuracy where 0 is best and 1 is worst:\nJanuary 2nd 2022 (11 months, 29 days before resolution): 0.16 March 12th 2022 (9 months, 19 days before resolution): 0.09 June 30th 2022 (6 months, 1 day before resolution): 0.49 August 1st 2022 (4 months, 30 days before resolution): 0.02 Overall average: 0.19 Mindy analyzes how her Brier score evolved over time and sees that it tanked on June 30th. Reading her reasoning at the time she decides that she should not have adjusted down her prediction so strongly given the other evidence she had. Instead she should have adjusted to maybe 55%. In the future she will be more careful in such situations. In general she will trust her gut feeling about people a little more, because she was right in her forecast after all.\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/docs/roadmap/","title":"Roadmap \u0026 Requirements","section":"Docs","content":" Roadmap \u0026amp; Requirements # Version 1 # The MVP (Minimal Viable Product) must implement the following features.\nWeb-based Make binary (yes/no) forecasts (title, description, probability of being true 0 - 100, datetime, reason for probability, closing date) Edit forecast. Modify title, description and closing date Update prediction. Allow modifying the probability 0 - 100 and attach a datetime to it. Add a reason for that probability. Allow viewing the history of probabilities for a forecast, including datetimes and the reason given at the time. Allow resolving a forecast as true, false or N/A. Add a comment when resolving. Calculate the Brier score for every probability of a forecast in the past Calculate the avg Brier score for the entire forecast Calculate the avg Brier score across all forecasts For personal usage at home Single binary, easy deployment cross platform desktop/server High degree of test automation and good documentation to make future development easy for busy and lazy people like myself Have an overview page with all forecasts. Sortable by: Last prediction update Creation date Last edit Resolution date Brier score Resolution Filter by: Resolution Display some statistics, possibly on the home page: Current average Brier score and evolution over time Forecasts added over time Number of updates over time Issue #20: It needs to be very easy and fast to add simple forecasts e.g. \u0026lsquo;Will I feel better tomorrow?\u0026rsquo;. These kinds of forecasts are rarely updated and require very little additional data. Possible later features # Allow choosing the datetime (default: now) when updating the probability of a prediction Have some kind of categories, possibly hierarchical to see Brier score for categories Version predictions whenever the title, description or resolution date is updated Probabilities always refer to a version When displaying a past probability display the version of the question at the time, in particular the resolution date set at the time (which indicates how much uncertainty there was at the time) Allow seeing avg Brier score X time before the resolution date (as known at the time) i.e. what is my avg Brier score two months before resolution, even if for one of the questions the resolution came 1 week later initially the resolution was predicted later. Multiple users for them to compare scores Allow having groups of people e.g. for company prediction tournaments Public instance where people can make predictions for other people to see app.cleodora.org ? Allow marking predictions as public, private or private within a group of people Always maintain self-deployment option for making personal predictions you don\u0026rsquo;t want to share with the Internet (e.g. personal relationships, personal goals, etc.) More scoring systems, not only Brier score Data import and export to transfers between private and public instances and to analyze with other tools Allow exporting/importing predictions as JSON to share with other people so they can predict in their own Cleodora instance. What to do when editing a question? New export that contains version information and can be merged? Allow exporting nice reports or graphs to brag and show other people Issue #23: Multi-answer questions. Always have one answer \u0026lsquo;other\u0026rsquo; that has 100 - sum(others) by default. When editing a question and adding new answers then those new answers get 0 probability initially. This can lead to drastic changes in Brier score (if \u0026lsquo;other\u0026rsquo; was rather large before), but that is fine. Notification when a forecast needs to be resolved. e.g. e-mail or push message in the browser, toast message in the corner etc. "},{"id":3,"href":"/docs/comparison/","title":"Comparison with other tools","section":"Docs","content":" Comparison with other tools # Manifold Markets # Cleodora is different from Manifold Markets because:\nRunning it locally on your computer will be the default and all forecasts are private whereas, on Manifold everything is public. Cleodora is about your own forecasts, not other people\u0026rsquo;s. You can directly measure the quality of your forecasts instead of only indirectly via the amount of M$ (mana) you earn over time, meaning you can better drill down where exactly you failed in specific instances. If the probability you currently predict is the same as the market, then in Manifold there is nothing you can do. Your ability to make a forecast depends on other people, whereas in Cleodora it\u0026rsquo;s only about you. Metaculus # Cleodora is different from Metaculus because:\nRunning it locally on your computer will be the default and all forecasts are private, whereas on Metaculus everything is public. Cleodora is about your own forecasts, not other people\u0026rsquo;s. You are able to make forecasts that are not of public interest, whereas on Metaculus all forecasts are carefully curated. PredictionBook # Cleodora is different from PredictionBook because:\nRunning it locally on your computer will be the default, and will be easier than with PredictionBook because Cleodora is single binary, no dependencies and Linux/OSX/Windows cross platform. To run PredictionBook locally you need Ruby on Rails. The Cleodora UI aims to look more modern and be mobile friendly. In PredictionBook it\u0026rsquo;s only possible to make binary (yes/no) forecasts whereas making ones with several possible answers is on the roadmap for Cleodora. Development of PredictionBook seems to have stopped, except for dependency updates and bug fixes. Note that this is not necessarily bad. If a tool does what it\u0026rsquo;s supposed to do, why continue tinkering with it? That being said, if you want a great and working tool right now, PredictionBook should be your choice. It essentially does everything Cleodora aims to do in the future. The Credence game is also really cool and fun, albeit a little US-centric.\nThe roadmap of Cleodora is filled with great features!

Essentially all decisions we take are based on vague gut-level predictions. For example before leaving for the airport you predict how much the traffic will delay you on your way, timing your departure appropriately. You also make a prediction about how likely you think it is your car will suffer a catastrophic engine failure on the road. If you thought this was very likely to happen, you would take a cab instead.\nMaking such forecasts explicit and tracking your accuracy can be incredibly valuable to hold yourself acountable (i.e. what did I really believe back then?), to communicate more clearly with other people and to discover systematic ways in which you are erring (e.g. you tend to be too optimistic concerning your favorite political party).\nA future event either happens or it doesn\u0026rsquo;t, does it make sense to attach a probability to it? # Many people find the idea of attaching a probability to a future event to be counter-intuitive. That is because one way of thinking about probability is when repeating an event many times. For example if you flip a coin 10.000 times it will land about 5.000 times on heads. Therefore we say there is a 50% probability of getting heads. Some events can\u0026rsquo;t be repeated however. What is the likelihood of the US president stepping down in the next year due to a conflict of interest with the rice industry? How do you repeat this event 10.000 times?\nA more helpful way of thinking about probabilities is belief. How likely do you believe something is going to happen (0 being you are certain it will never happen and 100 you are certain it will definitely happen)? If I flip a coin, how strongly do you believe heads will come up? Given your prior experience in the world you will probably believe 50% probability of heads. Or maybe you think I am the kind of person who has trick coins in their pocket and then you would only believe 10% probability of heads. The same can be applied to any future event. The strength of you belief can depend upon many things, and much more importantly, will vary over time because you get to see new data (evidence)! So maybe your belief that the US president will have to step down due to a conflict of interest with the rice industry is 0.001% . When you learn that he in fact owns large amounts of stock in rice companies your belief will possibly increase to 5%. Cleodora will help you keep track of your beliefs and once you find out the truth, how often you were right or wrong. This will aid you in forming more accurate beliefs in the future.\nYet another way of thinking about such probabilities is, how much money would you be willing to bet on it? For example if you believe there is a 5% chance the US president will step down in the next year due to a conflict of interest with the rice industry, then you consider the following bet fair: You bet $1 on YES and your friend Mindy bets $19 on NO. If it turns out you were right, you get her $19 and if it turns out she was right she gets your $1. You would not take the bet if she was only offering $15 and you would definitely take the bet if she was offering $20 . How this is calculated exactly (5/95 = 1/19 = 1:19 odds) does not matter, only that you have this intuition that if you think something is very likely to happen you would be willing to bet a lot of money on it and vice versa.\nWhy the focus on running Cleodora on your own computer? # To enable you to make deeply personal predictions (e.g. will my uncle find a new partner within the next 6 months?) without worrying about who gets to (accidentally) read your thoughts. Also it emphasizes the fact that the tool is about YOUR forecasts, not other people\u0026rsquo;s.\nGiven that it\u0026rsquo;s a web application you will be able to host it yourself e.g. on small home server and access it from any device within that network.\nLater versions of Cleodora will also have a public instance with multiple users, but the focus will always be on personal forecasts.\nWhy the name Cleodora? # Cleodora (/kliːəˈdɔːrə/) is a nymph from Greek mythology who was able to predict the future by casting stones. She and her sisters Melaina and Daphnis are known as the Thriae.\n"},{"id":10,"href":"/docs/credits/","title":"Credits","section":"Docs","content":" Credits # \u0026lsquo;External link\u0026rsquo; icon, used in the menu, free with attribution from flaticon.com "}]
